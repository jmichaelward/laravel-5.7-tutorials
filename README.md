# Learning Laravel 5.7
One of my goals for 2019 is to learn another application development
framework. Since I began my agency career in 2013, the first platform
I got to work in was WordPress, and I've more or less stuck with that
as my primary way of building websites for clients.

In 2019, I'm looking to branch out a bit, learn new some new skills,
and otherwise better comprehend difference approaches to software development.
Three years ago, I subscribed to [Laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com) so that I
could learn how to use Laravel to build my webapps. I've gone through a
number of tutorials on that site, everything from previous Intro to
Laravel courses, PhpStorm tips, Vim tips, "How to read code", PHP
tutorials, ES2016... I've watched a lot of videos, and I've learned a lot from
them. Something I haven't done to date, however, is actually _build_
something in another platform. This is the year that I change that.

[I documented my 2019 goals in a blog post on my website.](https://jmichaelward.com/rip-2018-you-were-kind-of-a-bust/),
and I'm dedicated to achieving as much as I can this year, because admittedly
I've let goal-setting slide in the past couple of years (I still learned a lot, but
there's a huge difference between learning something with intention and just arbitrarily
picking up skills, and I would way rather do the former). And, of course,
now that I've linked to that blog post, I realize that I forgot to write about
Laravel at all. Oops! Well, believe you me, it's on the list, along with Craft,
and React, and setting up some custom tools for work, and building a Docker container
from scratch, and... well, I've got my work cut out for me.

I've been hosting a weekly board game night at my house for the past three years,
and something I've long been wanting to do is build an application that organizes that
game night. Or, at least, communicate with the [BoardGameGeek API](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2)
so I can do something interesting with my own data. Such a project could be the perfect
way to dive into Laravel and solidify my understand of the Eloquent model,
content relationships, templating, and heck, maybe finally learn a thing or two about
Vue (I've never looked into it!).

Anyway, long story short, this repo is for Laracasts, and once I'm done, I'm
planning on starting up another project that will find its way online in one
way or another this year. If you came across this repo and happened to read all the
way to the end of this document, thanks for stopping by!
